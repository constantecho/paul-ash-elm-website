# Image Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder files for images needed by the ResonEcho website. Before deploying the website, these placeholders should be replaced with actual image files.

## Required Images

### Mesh Network Concept Images
- `mesh-concept.png` - General mesh network visualization used on the homepage
- `traditional-network.png` - Visualization of traditional network architecture (central infrastructure)
- `mesh-network-concept.png` - Visualization of mesh network architecture (device-to-device connections)
- `mesh-network.png` - Detailed mesh network architecture used on the product page
- `mesh-communication-flow.png` - Visualization of how mesh communication works

### Technical Concept Images
- `protocol-diagram.png` - Modified flooding mesh protocol visualization
- `power-management.png` - Adaptive power management visualization
- `message-persistence.png` - Store-and-forward message reliability visualization
- `group-management.png` - Decentralized group management visualization
- `message-routing.png` - Intelligent message routing visualization
- `store-forward.png` - Message persistence and reliability visualization

### Use Case Scenario Images
- `use-case-festival.jpg` - Festival communication scenario
- `use-case-hiking.jpg` - Remote adventure communication scenario
- `use-case-emergency.jpg` - Emergency communication scenario

## Image Specifications

For best results, the following specifications are recommended:

- All PNG images should be at least 800px wide
- Use a 16:9 aspect ratio for most technical visualizations
- Use consistent color schemes matching the website's design (primary and accent colors)
- Ensure images are optimized for web (compressed without quality loss)
- Include alt text for all images in the HTML
- Include the "Conceptual Visualization" or "Technical Concept" badge overlay for appropriate images

## Design Guidelines

When creating these images, consider the following design guidelines:

1. Use simple, clean illustrations that clearly communicate the concept
2. For technical diagrams, include labels and minimal explanatory text
3. For use case images, show people using devices in the specific scenarios
4. Use consistent visual language across all images
5. Ensure all text in images is readable at smaller screen sizes
